1,SE,18-20,"Internships have provided me with unparalleled exposure to the real-world application of software engineering principles. They allowed me to bridge the gap between theory and practice, providing hands-on experience in coding, problem-solving, and working in teams. The fast-paced, dynamic nature of these environments pushed me to develop new skills, adapt quickly to different technologies, and contribute to meaningful projects. The challenges I encountered during my internships gave me insight into industry trends, helping me refine my academic goals and career aspirations. Through these experiences, I developed a deeper passion for software engineering, particularly in areas like software development, system architecture, and coding efficiency.

Mentorship programs have been another critical factor in my career development. Having access to experienced professionals who offered guidance and advice allowed me to navigate the complexities of the software engineering industry with greater clarity. My mentors helped me identify my strengths and areas for improvement, encouraged me to pursue challenging opportunities, and gave me valuable feedback on my projects. Their insights on both technical skills and career planning have been instrumental in helping me make informed decisions about the direction of my academic journey and career.

University coursework also played a significant role in shaping my career. Courses in data structures, algorithms, software design, and computer systems provided the theoretical foundation for my work as a software engineer. In particular, project-based courses that mimicked real-world scenarios gave me the chance to apply my knowledge and collaborate with peers. The combination of rigorous coursework and collaborative projects helped me gain a solid understanding of core concepts, equipping me with the skills I needed to succeed in internships and, later, in the workplace.

Job shadowing and career fairs offered additional perspectives, enabling me to explore different career paths within software engineering. Observing professionals in action during job shadowing experiences allowed me to better understand the day-to-day responsibilities and workflows in various roles, from software developers to system analysts. Career fairs introduced me to potential employers, exposing me to a range of companies and technologies, and helping me gauge what different organizations expect from software engineers.

The encouragement and support of my family and friends have been crucial throughout this process. Their belief in my abilities has kept me motivated during challenging times and inspired me to persevere through difficult academic and professional milestones.",3.90,Yes,STEM,Male,"InternshipsMentorship programs, Research",4,3,3,5,3,4,5,4,5,No,English,Lower,5,"One critical experience universities should offer is internships integrated into academic programs.

2,Information Systems,21-23,"As an Information Systems (IS) student, your experiences likely have had a significant impact on shaping both your academic and career development. Here are a few ways that might manifest:

    Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking: Experiences in solving real-world business problems through technology may have fueled your interest in systems analysis, programming, and IT management. These skills are central to your academic choices, leading you to dive deeper into areas like data management, cybersecurity, or enterprise systems.

    Interest in Technology Integration: If you’ve had hands-on experience with software development, networking, or databases, you might be inclined to explore areas where technology can streamline business operations. This could lead you to specialize in areas like business intelligence, cloud computing, or IT consulting.",3.65,Yes,STEM,Male,"Mentorship programs, Searching professionals through social networks",3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,No,English,Lower,3,"Internships and Work-Based Learning

    Industry-Specific Internships: Expanding opportunities for students to intern with local businesses, NGOs, and government agencies would provide hands-on experience in their fields of study. Partnerships with various industries can also offer students tailored internships in fields like agriculture, tech, healthcare, and education.
    Short-Term Work Placements: Not all students are able to commit to long-term internships, so offering shorter-term placements (e.g., 2–3 weeks) can expose students to work environments without the time commitment of a full internship.

2. Professional Networking Events

    Career Fairs and Job Expos: Organizing regular career fairs and job expos where students can meet employers directly and explore job opportunities is essential. Bringing a mix of local and international companies would give students diverse options for their careers.
    Industry Networking Nights: Hosting networking nights where students can engage with alumni, professionals, and potential employers in an informal setting could help students develop professional relationships and gain insight into industry trends.
    Panel Discussions and Guest Speakers: Bringing in industry experts and successful alumni to speak about their career journeys and the future of their sectors can offer valuable learning experiences and inspiration.",No response,"Industry Collaboration and Networking Opportunities

    Partnerships with Industry: Universities should strengthen ties with local and international businesses to provide students with internship opportunities, job placements, and real-world insights. These partnerships could also lead to career fairs, guest lectures, and networking events featuring industry professionals.
    Alumni Networks: Building and actively maintaining alumni networks can provide valuable mentorship and career advice for current students. Alumni can also act as bridges between the university and potential employers.

2. Career Counseling and Personalized Support

    Tailored Career Counseling: Many students may not be aware of the full range of career options available to them. Offering personalized career counseling based on individual skills, interests, and academic strengths could guide students more effectively toward suitable career paths.
    Regular Career Assessments: Providing students with tools like personality assessments or career aptitude tests could help identify their strengths and align them with potential career options.

3. Skills Development and Job Readiness

    Soft Skills Training: While technical skills are essential, many employers also prioritize soft skills like communication, leadership, teamwork, and time management. Universities could offer workshops, seminars, and training sessions to help students improve these essential skills.
    Resume Building & Interview Preparation: Offering specialized workshops on resume writing, cover letter creation, and mock interview sessions can help students feel more confident and prepared when applying for jobs.

4. Job Market Insights and Career Guidance Materials

    Market Research and Data: Providing up-to-date information on job market trends in Ethiopia and globally, including emerging industries, salary ranges, and in-demand skills, would help students make informed career choices.
    Job Search Resources: Developing a centralized online portal or database where students can find job opportunities, internships, and career resources could make the job search process more organized and efficient.

5. Entrepreneurship and Freelancing Support

    Entrepreneurship Guidance: Given the limited availability of formal jobs in some sectors, universities could offer resources and support for students interested in starting their own businesses or working in the gig economy.
    Freelancer Networks: Creating networks for students interested in freelancing could allow them to connect with clients and other freelancers, as well as access resources to improve their work.",AAU

Stronger Industry Connections: Building partnerships with a broader range of industries and companies could help students gain access to internships, job shadowing opportunities, and career fairs that are more aligned with their fields of study. 

Workshops on Soft Skills: While technical skills are essential, soft skills like communication, leadership, and time management are equally important in the workplace. Offering regular workshops on these skills could help students feel more prepared and confident when applying for jobs or entering the workforce.

Alumni Networking: Establishing stronger connections with alumni and creating an accessible alumni network could be beneficial. Alumni often have valuable insights and advice about transitioning from university to the workforce and can offer mentorship or networking opportunities for current students.

Internship and Job Search Support: Many students find the job search process overwhelming. Offering support with resume building, interview preparation, and job search strategies would help students feel more confident and prepared. Additionally, creating a job portal that lists opportunities tailored to students' fields of study would be helpful.

Career Guidance for Non-Traditional Students: Providing more support for non-traditional students, such as mature students, those with family obligations, or students changing careers, would ensure that the services cater to everyone. Tailored resources, flexibility in career advising, and understanding the unique challenges they face could make a big difference.

the accelerated academic schedule that has significantly impacted the quality of our
education and preparation. 

While we deeply appreciate your efforts to uphold
educational standards nationwide, we feel that immediate intervention is required to
address challenges specific to our university. 
Currently, many of us so-called graduating students are being compelled to complete
our studies by the end of this year under an excessively compressed academic
timeline. 

This has not allowed us the time or opportunity to gain adequate knowledge
and preparation in our respective fields. 

The rushed academic schedule hinders
meaningful engagement with coursework, projects, and examinations, leaving us
feeling inadequately prepared for both professional and academic pursuits.
 We kindly propose the following solutions to mitigate these challenges:
1. Adopt a Standard Academic Calendar: Encourage Arsi University to
transition to the Ministry of Education’s standard two-semester system to
ensure sufficient time for learning, skill-building, and project completion. 
2. Quality Assurance Mechanisms: Review and enhance the current curriculum
and teaching methodologies to ensure students graduate with strong
foundational knowledge and skills.
3. Reevaluation of Forced Graduation Policies: Allow students more time to
complete their studies effectively rather than enforcing accelerated timelines, which compromise educational outcomes. 
4. Student and Faculty Collaboration Platforms: Introduce systems for
gathering and addressing feedback to improve decision-making processes. 

We strongly believe that under your guidance, these measures can restore fairness and
uphold the integrity of education at Arsi University. These steps will also ensure that
graduates from our institution are well-equipped to contribute meaningfully to
Ethiopia’s development.

 Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. We remain hopeful for immediate
action to address these concerns and improve the academic experience for current and
future students.

After registering all graduating class students, these agents classify the students into different categories for their own purposes. Companies that hire students through these agents may not be paying the correct taxes to the government. The taxes deducted from employees' gross salaries are often paid to the agents, who benefit from this arrangement. Additionally, universities are not actively supervising agents during the student registration process or monitoring where they place students. The government is also neglecting to oversee agents and the labor conditions of students.

It is recommended that universities and the government take steps to address these issues. Agents should not be intermediaries for student employment. Companies should directly advertise job openings on their official websites and recruit students directly from universities. Moreover, university career development officers should prioritize student grades and academic records when selecting students for job placements, rather than relying on personal factors.
