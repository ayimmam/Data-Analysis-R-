# University Career Guidance Analysis - R Visualization of Research Data

## 1. Project Overview

This project provides R scripts to visualize the key findings from the "Research Analysis Report" (Survey data from 471 university students in Ethiopia). The scripts generate each chart from the report, allowing for further analysis, customization, or integration into other platforms.

A core component of this project is the `00_data_preparation.R` script, which reconstructs the aggregated data from the report's text and charts. All subsequent plotting scripts load the output of this file (`reconstructed_data.RData`) to generate the visualizations.

## 2. File Structure

The repository is organized into separate R files, each corresponding to a specific section of the original report.

* **`readme.md`**: This documentation file.
* **`00_data_preparation.R`**: (Run this first) A script that reconstructs all necessary data frames from the report's summary statistics and chart values. It saves its output to `reconstructed_data.RData`.
* **`01_demographics.R`**: Generates all charts for the "Demographic Profile Analysis" section.
* **`02_exposure_participation.R`**: Generates all charts for the "Exposure Participation Analysis" section.
* **`03_exposure_influence.R`**: Generates all charts for the "Influence of Exposures on Career Choice" section.
* **`04_career_guidance.R`**: Generates all charts for the "Career Guidance Service" section.
* **`05_career_direction.R`**: Generates all charts for the "Career Direction" section.
* **`06_qualitative_analysis.R`**: Generates the three word clouds from the "Qualitative Analysis" section.
* **`07_correlation_analysis.R`**: Generates the correlation heatmap from the "Detailed Analysis of Strong Relationships" section.
* **`reconstructed_data.RData`**: (Generated by `00_data_preparation.R`) The data file loaded by scripts `01` through `07`.
* **`Plots`**: (Output of all `XX_data.R`) The data file loaded by scripts `01` through `07`.

## 3. Required R Libraries

To run all scripts, you must have the following R libraries installed.

```R
# Run this in your R console to install all required packages
install.packages(c(
  "ggplot2",    # For all plotting
  "dplyr",      # For data manipulation
  "tidyr",      # For data reshaping (e.g., pivoting)
  "wordcloud",  # For word clouds
  "RColorBrewer", # For color palettes
  "tm",         # For text mining (used by wordcloud)
  "reshape2",   # For melting data for heatmaps
  "ggrepel"     # For non-overlapping text labels
))
